# Fake-News-WebScrapper

This program currently scrapes a website that hosts multiple articles, news segments or posts from various social media outlets!

These articles, news segments and social media posts are categorized by the website in question into different ratings depending on the contents.

My program takes each posts claim, rating and then gains a collection of the ones that have been rated in a certain way.

From there it carries on throughout the website getting up-to 100 pages of 12 posts per page worth of content, scrapping and sifting through for the content that is most useful for my use case.
